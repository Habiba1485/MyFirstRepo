One of the most valuable things I’ve learned so far in this course is the importance of clear and logical thinking when writing code or solving problems. I’ve started to understand how programming isn’t just about typing commands, but about breaking down a problem into small, manageable steps. This skill has helped me become more confident in analyzing tasks, planning solutions, and using basic coding concepts like loops, variables, and conditionals.
