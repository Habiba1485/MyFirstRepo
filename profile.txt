My Favorite Hobby
One of my favorite hobbies is reading fiction, especially novels that transport me into different worlds and introduce me to unforgettable characters. I love how books can make me feel every emotion—joy, sadness, excitement—all within a few pages. Reading helps me relax, escape from stress, and expand my imagination. Whether it’s a mystery, fantasy, or romance, I find joy in getting lost in a good story. It also improves my vocabulary and helps me see the world from new perspectives, which makes it more than just a hobby—it’s a part of who I am.
